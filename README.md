getting started

* Site basing on css flexbox structure and responsive, although not mobile-first approach. 
* I have added some functionalities using basic jquery and css. Improvements are still needed. 
* Images compressed via FileOptimizer to improve load times. Animate.css modificated and downsized by myself.

It's my first project and any advice and suggestions will be greatly appreciated!
